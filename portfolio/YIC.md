Together, they launched the Youth Impact Challenge. It’s an idea competition for young people across the country who want to make a social/environmental impact.

This was their inaugural year - so they asked us to build a brand, a website, and run a national campaign that attracted 60+ high quality application. The only challenge: the application deadline was only a month away. So, we sprung into action. <br><br>

182 applications, <br>
More than tripling our goal. <br><br>

9,000 website visits <br>
Across 350+ Canadian cities. <br><br>

Attracted 689 followers <br>
from scratch in one month. " %}

We built symbiotic relationships brand partners, collaborated with relevant young influencers, and shared our content in digital community groups. Ultimately, we drove a massive Canada-wide campaign that engaged thousands of innovative young people.

We built content that we knew would resonate with our audience, and drove them through social media to a website.

The results speak for themselves." %}
