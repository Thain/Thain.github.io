With an eye towards supporting those on the economic and social margins, SoMM provides free music lessons in classrooms across Montreal. They see music not just as a skill to develop, but also as a way that one can feel a sense of ownership and safety in their learning." %}

{% include port-pgph.html title="The project" offset="3" offset-mobile="1" color="dorange" content="SoMM wanted a video that spoke to the things that they do, and the impact they have. The goal was to use it to attract volunteers and build meaningful partnerships with schools. We went into several classrooms to observe the learning process, and interviewed volunteers about the impact that they are having. The result? A beautiful video that speaks to the joy of music in one’s life." %}
