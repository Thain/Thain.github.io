{% include port-pgph.html title="The client" offset="2" color="dblue" content="Indigirecruit is a grassroots, Indigenous-led, organization that works with young Indigenous people to work through the college-application process. Their mission is to break down barriers for Indigenous youth trying to further their education. Right now, the application process is one of those barriers. They provide the tools and knowledge one might need to navigate that process successfully." %}

{% include port-pgph.html title="The project" offset="3" color="dorange" content="Indigirecruit, an emerging social enterprise, needed to build their brand from scratch. We worked with them to craft a visual identity that is true to their values and mission. After a lot of discovery and iteration, we landed on what you see before you. The icon, a book and a feather merged together, visually reflects the intersection between the organization’s two guiding principles: indigenous representation and access to education. With a bold typeface that introduces a modern twist, our goal was to capture the organization’s dynamic, ambitious, and community-driven spirit. In some variations of the logo, the feather replaces the third “i” of IndigIrecruit, emphasizing the message “I Recruit” and speaking to IndigIrecruit’s empowering nature. The identity also introduces a harmonious and bright color palette, including white and tones of purple – the colors of the Iroquois Confederacy." %}
